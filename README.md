# House-Price-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning-with-Python
The problem falls under the category of supervised learning algorithms. The dataset we’ll be using is the Boston Housing Dataset. The dataset comprises 13 input features and one target feature. The input features include features that may or may not impact the price.
The Boston data frame has 506 rows and 14 columns. Each row comprises one data-point and contains details about a plot. Various features affect the pricing of a house.

The Boston housing dataset has 14 features, out of which we’ll use 13 to train the model. The 14th feature is the price, which we’ll use as our target variable.

The table gives the list of features included in the dataset, along with their respective descriptions.
